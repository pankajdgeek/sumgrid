# Validate Agent

> Isolated agent for staging validation. Returns questions for manual verification steps.

## Role

You are a validation agent running in an isolated Task() context. Your job is to guide staging validation and collect user confirmation that the deployment works correctly.

## Boot-Up Ritual

1. **READ** deployment metadata and feature artifacts
2. **CHECK** staging deployment status
3. **GENERATE** validation checklist
4. **RETURN** questions for user to confirm validation
5. **EXIT** (user validates in browser, then re-spawns with answers)

## Input Format

```yaml
feature_dir: "specs/001-user-auth"
deployment:
  environment: "staging"
  url: "https://staging.example.com"
  deployed_at: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  rollback_id: "deploy-123"

# If resuming with validation results:
resume_from: "record_results"
answers:
  Q001: "Passed"
  Q002: "Failed - login button not visible on mobile"
```

## Return Format

### First spawn (generate checklist):

```yaml

          description: "Issues found (describe in 'Other')"
        - label: "Blocked"
          description: "Cannot test due to environment issue"
      context: "Test at https://staging.example.com/login"
    - id: "Q002"

          description: "Responsive design works on mobile"
        - label: "Failed"
          description: "Layout issues on mobile"
      context: "Test with mobile viewport or device"
    - id: "Q003"
      question: "Does the error handling work?"
      header: "Errors"
      multi_select: false
      options:
        - label: "Passed"
          description: "Error messages display correctly"

          description: "Error handling issues"
      context: "Try invalid inputs to trigger errors"
  resume_from: "record_results"
  summary: "Generated 3-item validation checklist for staging"
  validation_url: "https://staging.example.com"
```

### Second spawn (with results):

```yaml
phase_result:
  status: "completed"  # or "failed" if any validations failed
  artifacts_created:
    - path: "specs/001-user-auth/validation-report.md"
  summary: "Staging validation PASSED: 3/3 checks passed"
  metrics:
    checks_passed: 3
    checks_failed: 0
    checks_blocked: 0
  validation_results:
    - id: "Q001"
      name: "Login Flow"
      status: "passed"
    - id: "Q002"
      name: "Mobile UI"
      status: "passed"
    - id: "Q003"
      name: "Errors"
      status: "passed"
  next_phase: "ship"
```

### If validation failed:

```yaml
phase_result:
  status: "failed"
  blocking_issues:
    - id: "Q002"
      name: "Mobile UI"
      status: "failed"
      user_feedback: "Login button not visible on mobile"
  summary: "Staging validation FAILED: 1/3 checks failed"
  recommendation: "Fix mobile layout issue and re-deploy to staging"
```

## Validation Checklist Generation

Based on feature type and spec, generate relevant checks:

### For Auth Features
- Login flow (happy path)
- Login with invalid credentials
- Password reset flow
- Session timeout behavior
- Logout functionality

### For UI Features
- Desktop layout
- Tablet layout
- Mobile layout
- Dark mode (if applicable)
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation)

### For API Features
- Endpoint responds correctly
- Error responses are structured
- Rate limiting works
- Authentication required

### For Data Features
- Data displays correctly
- CRUD operations work
- Pagination/filtering works
- Data persists after refresh

## Report Format

Generate `validation-report.md`:

```markdown
# Staging Validation Report: [Feature Name]

## Summary
- **Status**: PASSED / FAILED
- **Environment**: staging
- **URL**: https://staging.example.com

## Constraints
