# Slash Commands Reference

**Location**: `.claude/commands/`
**Purpose**: Executable slash command specifications for the Spec-Flow workflow

All commands can be invoked via `/command-name` in Claude Code. Each command is self-contained with embedded bash/PowerShell scripts.

## Command Status Legend

- ✅ **Stable**: Production-ready, well-tested
- 🚧 **Beta**: Functional but may change
- ⚙️ **Internal**: Called by other commands, not for direct use
- ⏳ **Needs v2.0**: Requires refactoring to v2.0 pattern
- ✅ **Done**: Already refactored to v2.0

---

## v2.0 Refactor Pattern

Commands marked "Needs v2.0" should be refactored to include:

1. **Strict bash mode**: `set -Eeuo pipefail`
2. **Error trap**: `trap on_error ERR` for cleanup
3. **Tool preflight checks**: `need()` function
4. **Non-interactive**: No `read -p` prompts (fail fast with actionable errors)
5. **Deterministic repo root**: `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`
6. **Actionable errors**: Clear fix instructions in error messages
7. **Concrete examples**: Evidence-backed with real commands/URLs
8. **Comprehensive docs**: Include REFACTOR-v2.md documentation

**Already refactored (v2.0)**:
- ✅ `/build-local` - Strict bash, Corepack, SBOM generation
- ✅ `/branch-enforce` - Robust detection, JSON output, auto-fix
- ✅ `/clarify` - Anti-hallucination, repo precedent, atomic commits
- ✅ `/constitution` - Structured actions, evidence-backed policies (WCAG, OWASP)
- ✅ `/deploy-prod` - Non-interactive, platform-specific rollback (Vercel, Railway, Netlify, Git)
- ✅ `/optimize` - Parallel checks, binary pass/fail, evidence-backed standards (WCAG, OWASP, Twelve-Factor)
- ✅ `/fix-ci` - Verified GitHub CLI commands, correct tool flags, generic quota handling
- ✅ `/spec` - Consolidated bash (15 blocks → 1), error trap with rollback, tool checks
- ✅ `/plan` - Consolidated bash (9 blocks → 1), removed interactive prompts, project docs mandatory
- ✅ `/tasks` - Consolidated bash sections, anti-hallucination rules, task organization by user stories
- ✅ `/implement` - Consolidated bash (4 blocks → 1), parallel batch execution, TDD workflow, domain-based grouping

**Directory Benefits**:
- Improved navigation and discoverability
- Logical grouping by function
- Easier to find related commands
- Scalable as new commands are added

**Note**: Slash command loader automatically searches subdirectories

## Typical Workflows

### Greenfield Feature (Full Workflow)

```bash
/init-project              # One-time project setup
/roadmap                   # Brainstorm and prioritize features
/feature "User login"      # Orchestrates: spec → clarify → plan → tasks → implement
/ship                      # Orchestrates: optimize → preview → deploy (model-specific)
```

### Brownfield Feature (Existing Project)

```bash
/feature "Add password reset"
/ship
```

### Quick Fix (Skip Planning)

```bash
/quick "Fix typo in navbar"
```

### Debug Workflow

```bash
/implement                 # Fails with error
/debug                     # Investigate and track error
/implement                 # Retry after fix
```

### Manual Phase Control

```bash
/spec "Dark mode toggle"
/clarify                   # If ambiguities found
/plan
/tasks
/implement
/validate                  # Cross-artifact consistency check
/optimize                  # Quality gates
/preview                   # Manual testing
/ship                      # Deploy
```

## Command Conventions

### Frontmatter (YAML)

All commands should have:

```yaml
---
description: Brief description (used in command list)
internal: true  # Optional: mark as internal-only
---
```

### Command Structure

**Recommended sections**:

1. **Purpose**: What the command does
2. **When to use**: Specific scenarios
3. **Prerequisites**: What must be complete before running
4. **Phases**: Numbered execution steps with bash/PowerShell code
5. **Error Recovery**: Common failures and fixes
6. **Success Criteria**: What "done" looks like
7. **Notes**: Important caveats or context

### Bash/PowerShell Blocks

**All scripts should**:
- Use strict mode (`set -Eeuo pipefail` for bash)
- Include error traps
- Check for required tools early
- Provide actionable error messages
- Be idempotent (safe to re-run)

## Adding New Commands

1. **Create command file**: `.claude/commands/your-command.md`
2. **Add frontmatter**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: What your command does
   ---
   ```
3. **Follow v2.0 pattern**: See "v2.0 Refactor Pattern" above
4. **Update this README**: Add to appropriate category table
5. **Test**: Verify command works on Windows and Unix
6. **Document**: Create `REFACTOR-v2.md` in `.spec-flow/memory/`
7. **Commit**: Use Conventional Commits format
