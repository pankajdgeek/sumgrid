## Prioritized Refactor Queue

### Priority 1: Critical Path (High Usage, High Impact)

**Must be refactored next** - These are the core workflow commands users interact with most.

| Command | Priority | Reason | Estimated Effort | Issues |
|---------|----------|--------|------------------|--------|
| `/spec` | 🔴 Critical | Entry point for all features | Medium | Likely has interactive prompts |
| `/plan` | 🔴 Critical | Core planning phase | Medium | May have editor opening |
| `/tasks` | 🔴 Critical | Task breakdown phase | Medium | Unknown interactive elements |
| `/implement` | 🔴 Critical | Main implementation orchestrator | High | Complex, likely has prompts |
| `/ship` | 🔴 Critical | Unified deployment orchestrator | High | Complex state machine |

**Estimated time**: 2-3 days for all 5 commands

---

### Priority 2: Deployment Pipeline (Medium-High Usage)

**Stabilize deployment workflow** - After `/ship` is refactored, these support commands should follow.

| Command | Priority | Reason | Estimated Effort | Issues |
|---------|----------|--------|------------------|--------|
| `/ship-staging` | 🟡 High | Staging deployment | Medium | May have interactive merge confirmation |
| `/validate-staging` | 🟡 High | Manual gate before prod | Low | Likely just checklist display |
| `/ship-prod` | 🟡 High | Production promotion | Medium | Similar to `/deploy-prod` (done) |
| `/optimize` | 🟡 High | Quality gates | High | Multiple sub-checks, complex |
| `/preview` | 🟡 High | Manual testing gate | Low | Checklist + dev server instructions |

**Estimated time**: 2 days for all 5 commands

---

### Priority 3: Quality & Validation (Medium Usage)

**Strengthen quality gates** - Less frequent but important for production readiness.

| Command | Priority | Reason | Estimated Effort | Issues |
|---------|----------|--------|------------------|--------|
| `/validate` | 🟡 High | Cross-artifact consistency | Medium | Analysis-heavy, may have interactive fixes |
| `/fix-ci` | 🟢 Medium | CI blocker resolution | Medium | Debugging workflow, may prompt for fixes |
| `/debug` | 🟢 Medium | Error investigation | Medium | Interactive debugging prompts likely |
| `/gate-ci` | 🟢 Medium | CI quality gate | Low | Beta status, may be simple |
| `/gate-sec` | 🟢 Medium | Security gate | Low | Beta status, may be simple |

**Estimated time**: 1.5 days for all 5 commands

---

### Priority 4: Project Management (Low-Medium Usage)

**One-time or infrequent commands** - Important but not on critical path.

| Command | Priority | Reason | Estimated Effort | Issues |
|---------|----------|--------|------------------|--------|
| `/init-project` | 🟢 Medium | One-time setup | High | Interactive questionnaire (15 questions) |
| `/roadmap` | 🟢 Medium | Feature planning | Medium | May have interactive brainstorming |
| `/update-project-config` | 🔵 Low | Infrequent updates | Low | Simple config updates |
| `/finalize` | 🟢 Medium | Workflow completion | Low | Cleanup tasks, likely safe |
| `/feature` | 🔴 Critical | Main orchestrator | High | **Complex: orchestrates all phases** |

**Estimated time**: 2 days for all 5 commands

**Note**: `/feature` is critical but should be refactored **after** all phase commands, since it orchestrates them.

---

### Priority 5: Deployment Support (Low Usage)

**Supporting deployment commands** - Used in specific scenarios.

| Command | Priority | Reason | Estimated Effort | Issues |
|---------|----------|--------|------------------|--------|

| `/deployment-budget` | 🔵 Low | Quota tracking | Low | Metrics display, safe |
| `/check-env` | 🔵 Low | Env var validation | Low | Simple checks |

**Estimated time**: 1 day for all 5 commands

---

### Priority 6: Infrastructure (Beta, Low Usage)

**Feature flags, contracts, fixtures** - Beta features, can wait.

| Command | Priority | Reason | Estimated Effort | Issues |
|---------|----------|--------|------------------|--------|

---

## Common Issues to Watch For

Based on the 5 refactors already completed, expect these patterns:

### 1. Interactive Editor Opening

**Before**:
```bash
code --wait "$FILE"
```

**After**: Remove entirely, use LLM-based edits or structured updates

**Examples**: `/constitution`, potentially `/plan`

---

### 2. Interactive Prompts

**Before**:
```bash
read -p "Commit changes? (yes/no): " SHOULD_COMMIT
```

**After**: Fail fast with actionable error

```bash
if ! git diff --quiet; then
  echo "❌ Uncommitted changes detected"
  echo "Fix: git add . && git commit -m 'message'"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Examples**: `/deploy-prod`, potentially `/spec`, `/implement`

---

### 3. Missing Tool Checks

**Before**: Assumes tools exist, fails deep in script

**After**: Preflight checks with `need()` function

```bash
need() {
  command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
    echo "❌ Missing required tool: $1"
    echo "   Install via: brew install $1"
    exit 1
  }
}

need git
need gh
need yq
need jq
```

**Examples**: All commands

---

### 4. Typos and Syntax Errors

**Before**: `n#` instead of `#`, missing quotes

**After**: Clean syntax, shellcheck validation

**Examples**: `/build-local`, `/deploy-prod` (both had `n#` typos)

---

### 5. Missing Error Traps

**Before**: Failures leave orphaned state

**After**: Trap ensures cleanup

```bash
on_error() {
  echo "⚠️  Error in /command. Marking phase as failed."
  complete_phase_timing "$FEATURE_DIR" "phase" 2>/dev/null || true
  update_workflow_phase "$FEATURE_DIR" "phase" "failed" 2>/dev/null || true
}
trap on_error ERR
```

**Examples**: All commands should have this

---

### 6. Vague Error Messages

**Before**: "Error occurred"

**After**: Actionable instructions

```bash
echo "❌ Workflow missing 'on: workflow_dispatch' trigger"
echo "   Required for manual deployment via gh CLI"
echo ""
echo "Add to .github/workflows/deploy.yml:"
echo "  on:"
echo "    workflow_dispatch:"
```

**Examples**: `/deploy-prod`, should be applied to all commands

---

### 7. Hardcoded Paths

**Before**: Assumes current directory is correct

**After**: Deterministic repo root

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
```

**Examples**: All commands

---

### 8. Platform-Specific Assumptions

**Before**: Bash-only or Windows-only

**After**: OS detection and branching

```bash
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "msys" || "$OSTYPE" == "win32" ]]; then
  # Windows
  pwsh -Command "..."
else
  # Unix
  bash script.sh
fi
```

**Examples**: Commands with PowerShell/bash alternatives

---

## Directory Reorganization

**After refactors complete**, reorganize into subdirectories:

1. Create subdirectories (`core/`, `phases/`, `deployment/`, etc.)
2. Move commands to appropriate subdirectories
3. Update slash command loader to search subdirectories
4. Update references in skills and agents
5. Add symlinks for backward compatibility
6. Update README.md with new structure
7. Migrate over 2-3 weeks with feature flags

**Estimated effort**: 1-2 days after all refactors complete

---

## Testing Strategy

### Per-Command Testing

1. **Syntax check**: `shellcheck command.md` (extract bash blocks)
2. **Dry-run test**: Run command in test feature directory
3. **Error path test**: Trigger each error condition and verify messages
4. **Windows test**: Run on Windows with PowerShell
5. **Unix test**: Run on macOS/Linux with bash
6. **CI test**: Run in GitHub Actions (if applicable)

### Integration Testing

1. **Full workflow test**: `/feature` → `/ship` end-to-end
2. **Error recovery test**: Trigger failure, verify state cleanup
3. **Idempotency test**: Run same command twice, verify no side effects
4. **Parallel test**: Run multiple features concurrently
