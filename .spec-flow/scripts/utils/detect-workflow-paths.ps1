.SYNOPSIS
Detects workflow type (epic vs feature) and returns base directory.

.DESCRIPTION
Detection priority (as per user preference):
1. Workspace files (epics/*/epic-spec.md OR specs/*/spec.md)
2. Git branch pattern (epic/* OR feature/*)
3. state.yaml (workflow_type field)
4. Return failure code for fallback to AskUserQuestion

.OUTPUTS
JSON object with workflow information including worktree detection

.EXAMPLE
.\detect-workflow-paths.ps1

.NOTES
Exit codes: 0=success, 1=detection failed
